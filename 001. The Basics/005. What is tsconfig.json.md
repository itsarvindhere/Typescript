When working with Typescript, the most common file is a "tsconfig.json" file. As the name suggests, this file has the Typescript configuration for the current project.

The TypeScript compiler, which compiles .ts files to .js files, has a lot of options to change the compiler's behavior. You can pass these options from the command line, but creating a tsconfig.json file is a more convenient way to configure these options. The tsconfig.json file also specifies that the directory is the root of a TypeScript project.

The tsconfig.json is a configuration file containing a single object that allows you to customize how your TypeScript compiler compiles the TypeScript files to JavaScript files and specifies the root files.

# HOW TO CREATE A tsconfig.json FILE?

The simplest way is to use the Typescript compiler to create the tsconfig file. For that, in the root of your project, you can run the following command in the terminal - 

    tsc --init

This will create a new file named "tsconfig.json" in the project's root directory.

If you open the file, you will see that it contains a single object with different properties in it. There is a property named 'compilerOptions' which has various flags for the typescript compiler.

For example, to set the target ECMAScript version, there is the "target" property and by default it is set to "es2016".

And that's the basic idea of the tsconfig.json file. There are a lot of flags and we don't have to remember them.
